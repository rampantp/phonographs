 Welcome to my Phonograph Collection Site!  I’ve started this webpage just to share some of my interest and enthusiasm for this hobby.  I’ve been actively collecting and restoring phonographs since my teens and have showcased the different models I have collected since then below.  Early on, I started restoring some “basket case” machines that were more affordable for me and I also wanted to share some of my journey in learning how to bring them back to life!  Please enjoy my gallery of these early and interesting acoustic machines! 
<br>I first became interested in phonographs when I was still in high school.  My dad gave me his old turntable - a Zenith Alegro Sound System from the mid 70's - and his collection of Beatles records to listen to and I've been hooked on records and record players since.  While vacationing with my family, we went shopping at an antique store in northern Wisconsin where I first saw an acoustic phonograph in person - a Brunswick Ultona console model.  I was so fascinated by the fact that the entire unit was mechanical and acoustic - it didn't require any power other than winding up the motor to play music!  As I was still in school, I couldn't afford that Brunswick, but I was inspired to learn all I could about these early phonographs.  I read several books, notably "The Complete Talking Machine" by Eric L. Reiss which was an incredible wealth of knowledge on phonographs.  While I hoped to someday have one of the earliest phonographs with the fancy morning glory horn, I realized I could start small by restoring some of the more common models more affordably.
